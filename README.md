# Youtube Playlist Downloader
In order to understand BeautifulSoup 4, and work with OS commands, I created this python script, so that downloading playlist becomes easy.

#### How to use?
The executables are available in the `dist` directory, place them in the target directory, and run the ytdownloader script.

Please note that the youtube-dl.exe is necessary for this to work.
